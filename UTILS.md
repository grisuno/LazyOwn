## getprompt
Generate a command prompt string with network information and user status.

:param: None

:returns: A string representing the command prompt with network information and user status.

Manual execution:
To manually get a prompt string with network information and user status, ensure you have `get_network_info()` implemented to return a dictionary of network interfaces and their IPs. Then use the function to create a prompt string based on the current user and network info.

Example:
If the function `get_network_info()` returns:
    {
        'tun0': '10.0.0.1',
        'eth0': '192.168.1.2'

## xor_encrypt_decrypt
Encrypts or decrypts data using XOR encryption with the provided key.

Parameters:
data (bytes or bytearray): The input data to be encrypted or decrypted.
