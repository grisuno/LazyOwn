  gen_dll_rev is a next-generation, automated framework for generating, obfuscating, and delivering gen_dll_rev in pure C to windows machines. Designed for red team operations, penetration testing, and offensive research, gen_dll_rev empowers attackers to deploy stealthy, payloads that execute directly in memory â€” bypassing traditional AV/EDR detection mechanisms using Early Bird APC Injection and NT Native API Calls.
