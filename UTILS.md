a warning message instructing the user on how to exit the program using the
commands 'exit', 'q', or 'qa'.

:param sig: The signal number.
:type sig: int
:param frame: The current stack frame.
:type frame: frame
:return: None

## check_rhost
Checks if the remote host (rhost) is defined and shows an error message if it is not.

This function verifies if the `rhost` parameter is set. If it is not defined,
an error message is printed, providing an example and directing the user to
additional help.

:param rhost: The remote host to be checked.
:type rhost: str
:return: True if rhost is defined, False otherwise.
:rtype: bool

## check_lhost
Checks if the local host (lhost) is defined and shows an error message if it is not.

This function verifies if the `lhost` parameter is set. If it is not defined,
an error message is printed, providing an example and directing the user to
additional help.

:param lhost: The local host to be checked.
:type lhost: str
:return: True if lhost is defined, False otherwise.
:rtype: bool

## check_lport
Checks if the local port (lport) is defined and shows an error message if it is not.

This function verifies if the `lport` parameter is set. If it is not defined,
an error message is printed, providing an example and directing the user to
additional help.

:param lport: The local port to be checked.
:type lport: int or str
:return: True if lport is defined, False otherwise.
:rtype: bool

## is_binary_present
Internal function to verify if a binary is present on the operating system.

This function checks if a specified binary is available in the system's PATH
by using the `which` command. It returns True if the binary is found and False
otherwise.

:param binary_name: The name of the binary to be checked.
:type binary_name: str
:return: True if the binary is present, False otherwise.
:rtype: bool

## handle_multiple_rhosts
Internal function to handle multiple remote hosts (rhost) for operations.

This function is a decorator that allows an operation to be performed across
multiple remote hosts specified in `self.params["rhost"]`. It converts a single
remote host into a list if necessary, and then iterates over each host,
performing the given function with each host. After the operation, it restores
the original remote host value.

:param func: The function to be decorated and executed for each remote host.
:type func: function
:return: The decorated function.
:rtype: function

## check_sudo
Checks if the script is running with superuser (sudo) privileges, and if not,
restarts the script with sudo privileges.

This function verifies if the script is being executed with root privileges
by checking the effective user ID. If the script is not running as root,
it prints a warning message and restarts the script using sudo.

:return: None

## activate_virtualenv
Activates a virtual environment and starts an interactive shell.

This function activates a virtual environment located at `venv_path` and then
launches an interactive bash shell with the virtual environment activated.

:param venv_path: The path to the virtual environment directory.
:type venv_path: str
:return: None

## parse_proc_net_file
Internal function to parse a /proc/net file and extract network ports.

This function reads a file specified by `file_path`, processes each line to
extract local addresses and ports, and converts them from hexadecimal to decimal.
The IP addresses are converted from hexadecimal format to standard dot-decimal
notation. The function returns a list of tuples, each containing an IP address
and a port number.

:param file_path: The path to the /proc/net file to be parsed.
:type file_path: str
:return: A list of tuples, each containing an IP address and a port number.
:rtype: list of tuple

## get_open_ports
Internal function to get open TCP and UDP ports on the operating system.

This function uses the `parse_proc_net_file` function to extract open TCP and UDP
ports from the corresponding /proc/net files. It returns two lists: one for TCP
ports and one for UDP ports.

:return: A tuple containing two lists: the first list with open TCP ports and
        the second list with open UDP ports.
:rtype: tuple of (list of tuple, list of tuple)

## find_credentials
Searches for potential credentials in files within the specified directory.

This function uses a regular expression to find possible credentials such as
passwords, secrets, API keys, and tokens in files within the given directory.
It iterates through all files in the directory and prints any matches found.

:param directory: The directory to search for files containing credentials.
:type directory: str
:return: None

## rotate_char
Internal function to rotate characters for ROT cipher.

This function takes a character and a shift value, and rotates the character
by the specified shift amount. It only affects alphabetical characters, leaving
non-alphabetical characters unchanged.

:param c: The character to be rotated.
:type c: str
:param shift: The number of positions to shift the character.
:type shift: int
:return: The rotated character.
:rtype: str

## get_network_info
No description available.

## getprompt
Generate a command prompt string with network information and user status.

:param: None

:returns: A string representing the command prompt with network information and user status.

Manual execution:
To manually get a prompt string with network information and user status, ensure you have `get_network_info()` implemented to return a dictionary of network interfaces and their IPs. Then use the function to create a prompt string based on the current user and network info.

Example:
If the function `get_network_info()` returns:
    {
        'tun0': '10.0.0.1',
        'eth0': '192.168.1.2'
    }

And the user is root, the prompt string generated might be:
    [LazyOwn👽10.0.0.1]# 
If the user is not root, it would be:
    [LazyOwn👽10.0.0.1]$ 

If no 'tun' interface is found, the function will use the first available IP or fallback to '127.0.0.1'.

## wrapper
internal wrapper of internal function to implement multiples rhost to operate.
