description: >
  beacon is a next-generation, automated framework for generating, obfuscating, and delivering beacon in pure C to windows machines. Designed for red team operations, penetration testing, and offensive research, beacon empowers attackers to deploy stealthy, payloads that execute directly in memory â€” bypassing traditional AV/EDR detection mechanisms using Early Bird APC Injection and NT Native API Calls.
