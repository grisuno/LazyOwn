    "sessions/reports/executive_report.json": "Based on the provided NMAP output and the detailed analysis, I will generate a detailed action plan for penetration testing.\n\n**Reconnaissance**\n\n1. Using the `nmap` tool, perform a comprehensive scan of the target IP address (10.10.11.78) to gather more information about the open ports, services, and operating system.\n```bash\nnmap -A -v 10.10.11.78\n```\n2. Utilize `dnsrecon` to gather DNS-related information about the target domain (Mirage.htb).\n```bash\ndnsrecon -d mirage.htb -t axfr\n```\n3. Employ `enum4linux` to enumerate the target domain (Mirage.htb) and gather information about the domain's users, groups, and shares.\n```bash\nenum4linux -a mirage.htb\n```\n\n**Kerberos and LDAP**\n\n1. Utilize `kerbrute` to perform a password spraying attack against the Kerberos service (port 88) to identify valid usernames.\n```bash\nkerbrute -d mirage.htb -U users.txt -P passwords.txt\n```\nAssuming the `kerbrute` tool reveals valid users, let's say `j.fleischman` and `jhon.w`, we will add them to our action plan.\n\n**Action Plan**\n\n1. **Exploit Kerberos**: Using the valid usernames (`j.fleischman` and `jhon.w`) obtained from the `kerbrute` tool, attempt to exploit the Kerberos service (port 88) to gain access to the system.\n2. **LDAP Enumeration**: Utilize `ldapsearch` to gather more information about the LDAP service (port 389) and the domain's structure.\n```bash\nldapsearch -x -h 10.10.11.78 -p 389 -b \"dc=mirage,dc=htb\"\n```\n3. **Password Cracking**: Use the obtained usernames and passwords to attempt to crack the passwords using tools like `john` or `hashcat`.\n4. **Exploit Services**: Based on the information gathered, identify potential vulnerabilities in the services running on the target system and attempt to exploit them to gain access to the system.\n5. **Privilege Escalation**: Once access is gained, attempt to escalate privileges to gain higher-level access to the system.\n\n**Exposed Credentials**\n\nThe `exposed_credentials` section of the analysis reveals several instances of credentials being written to a file using the `echo` command. These credentials can be used to gain access to the system. Let's add them to our action plan:\n\n* `j.fleischman:J0elTHEM4n1990!`\n* `jhon.w:RFulUtONCOL!`\n\nThese credentials can be used to attempt to gain access to the system using the Kerberos or LDAP services.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1. Investigate the system's operating system and services to understand potential vulnerabilities.\n2. Research known vulnerabilities in the identified software and services.\n3. Utilize the obtained usernames and passwords to attempt to gain access to the system.\n4. Escalate privileges to gain higher-level access to the system.\n\n**Tools and Resources**\n\n* `nmap`\n* `dnsrecon`\n* `enum4linux`\n* `kerbrute`\n* `ldapsearch`\n* `john` or `hashcat` for password cracking\n\nNote: The action plan is based on the provided analysis and may require modifications as new information is gathered during the penetration testing process."
