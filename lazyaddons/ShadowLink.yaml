  ShadowLink is a next-generation, automated framework for generating, obfuscating, and delivering shellcode through in-memory loaders. Designed for red team operations, penetration testing, and offensive research, ShadowLink empowers attackers to deploy stealthy, fileless payloads that execute directly in memory â€” bypassing traditional AV/EDR detection mechanisms.
